I’m an Azure DevOps Expert with 5.5+ years of experience in building cloud-native infrastructure, automating deployments, and driving DevOps culture across teams. I specialize in leveraging Microsoft Azure, Kubernetes, and Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) to deliver scalable, secure, and cost-optimized solutions.

🚀 What I Do
Cloud Automation – Automate provisioning & deployments using Terraform, Azure DevOps, and GitHub Actions.

CI/CD Excellence – Design and optimize pipelines enabling zero-downtime releases.

Containerized Architectures – Deploy and manage microservices with Docker & Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

Observability & Reliability – Implement monitoring with Prometheus, Grafana & Azure Monitor, ensuring proactive issue detection.

Cloud Security – Apply RBAC, Azure Key Vault, and compliance-driven CI/CD workflows.
